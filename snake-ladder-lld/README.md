# Snake and Ladder Game - System Design

This project implements a simple Snake and Ladder game in C++. The code structure follows a modular design with separate classes for `Player`, `Board`, `Dice`, `Game`, and `Mover`.

## Classes

### Player
- Represents a player in the game.
- Stores player name and ID.

### Board
- Represents the game board with snakes and ladders.
- Initializes the board with the specified size and sets up snakes and ladders.

### Dice
- Simulates a six-sided die for rolling.
- We can have multiple dices in the game.
- Generates random numbers within a specified range.

### Mover
- Manages player movement on the board.
- Handles snake and ladder interactions.

### Game
- Orchestrates the overall game.
- Manages player turns, dice rolling, and player movement.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-and-ladder.git
```

2. Compile the code.

```bash
cd snake-and-ladder
make
```

3. Run the executable.

```bash
./my_program
```

## Configuration

- You can customize the game by modifying the `main` function in `main.cpp`.
- Adjust the board size, number of dice, snake positions, ladder positions, and player details.
